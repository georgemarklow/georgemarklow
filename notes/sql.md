# SQL

## Querying data from a table

### Query data in columns c1, c2 from a table
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t;
```
###  Query all rows and columns from a table
``` sql
SELECT * FROM t;
```
### Query data and filter rows with a condition
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
WHERE condition;
```
### Query distinct rows from a table
``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT c1 FROM t
WHERE condition;
```
### Sort the result set in ascending or descending order
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
ORDER BY c1 ASC [DESC];
```
### Skip offset of rows and return the next n rows
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
ORDER BY c1 
LIMIT n OFFSET offset;
```
### Group rows using an aggregate function
``` sql
SELECT c1, aggregate(c2)
FROM t
GROUP BY c1;
```
### Filter groups using HAVING clause
``` sql
SELECT c1, aggregate(c2)
FROM t
GROUP BY c1
HAVING condition;
```

# Querying from multiple tables

## Inner join t1 and t2
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 
FROM t1
INNER JOIN t2 ON condition;
```

## Left join t1 and t1
``` sql
SELECT c1, c2 
FROM t1
LEFT JOIN t2 ON condition;
```

## Right join t1 and t2


SELECT c1, c2 
FROM t1
RIGHT JOIN t2 ON condition;

CREATE TABLE t(
    c1 INT, c1 INT,
    UNIQUE(c2,c3)
);
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
Ensure c1 > 0 and values in c1 >= c2

CREATE TABLE t(
  c1 INT, c2 INT,
  CHECK(c1> 0 AND c1 >= c2)
);

Set values in c2 column not NULL

CREATE TABLE t(
     c1 INT PRIMARY KEY,
     c2 VARCHAR NOT NULL
);
