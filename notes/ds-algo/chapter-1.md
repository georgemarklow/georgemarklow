# Chapter 1 - Algorithms Analysis

#### Asymptotic Analysis
- Compares the efficiency of algorithm independent of data or programming language
- Interested in order of growth, not exact times to run

#### Big-O Notation
- If f(n) = O(g(n)) there are constants c and n0 st f(n) <= c.g(n) for all n >= n0	

| Name      | Notation |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Constant      | O(1)       |
| Logarithmic   | O(logn)        |
| Linear | O(n) |
| N-LogN | O(n log n) |
| Quadratic | O(n2) |
| Polynomial | O(nc) |
| Exponential | O(cm) |
| Factorial or N-power-N | O(n!) or O(nn) |
