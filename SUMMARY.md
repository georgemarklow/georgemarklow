## My values

Things that are important to me:

1. **Charity** üí∏ Don't give money to charity now-and-then; pick a charity and make a commitment to give them a monthly donation. Take advantage of any donation-matching scheme that your employer offers to increase your contributions. Also, take the time to understand the issues that your charity addresses. These issues are often complex and it might help to do some background reading. Reach out to the charity and offer your time to write articles for their newsletter or do fundraising - nobody is a mindreader and you need to ask.

2. **Volunteering** ‚úã The number one reason to volunteer is that it makes you feel good about yourself. Sure, it improves peoples' lives and helps you to gain skills that you might not use in your daily job - both also good reasons for volunteering. But making yourself feel good is the most important reason because when that happens, you'll begin to feel more confident and powerful, knowing you have a values system in place. Everybody around you will be able to see that. That confidence attracts people. That also attracts career opportunities, as employers will want somebody like you around.

3. **Stop Hate** ‚õîÔ∏è Make a vow with yourself to report hate crime as soon as you see it, and don't just assume that somebody else will report it to be taken care of.

4. **Financial Security** üìà Writing a budget makes you feel more powerful, even if your finances are right now not in a great state. Its important to know exactly how much is coming in and out and on what dates. If you have debt, know the balance of that debt by the end of each year and find out the month and year when the debt will be paid off. Have a 6-month emergency fund, which will reduce your anxiety going into work and in life in general. Make sure that you have the protections in place so that if you suddendly become ill, you know things are going to be taken care of financially.
