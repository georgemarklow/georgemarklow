### Howdy 👋

#### I'm a software engineer, author, blogger, and tech enthusiast who believes in helping others to make us happier and healthier.

- 📚: Digital Handbook: I maintain a [**Personal Handbook**](https://github.com/georgemarklow/georgemarklow/blob/main/SUMMARY.md) where I store important notes, links and other interesting stuff. 
- 🌱 My skills are C#, Javascript, Typescript, Angular, NgRx and RxJs
- 💬 Ask me about **Software Engineering**, **Becoming an Author** and **Public Speaking**! 
- 🧘🏻‍♂️ I'm a documentaries junkie (esp. Vietnam war and other conflicts), and I also enjoy writing blogs and working with music in the background from the 60s, 70s and 80s mostly, with the occasional minimal techno when I need to concentrate on a difficult task.
