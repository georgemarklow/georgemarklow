### Howdy 👋

#### I'm a software engineer, author, blogger, and abstract artist who believes in helping others to make us happier and healthier.

- 🌱 My skills are C#, Javascript, Typescript, Angular, NgRx and RxJs
- 💬 Ask me about **Software Engineering**, **Becoming an Author** and **Public Speaking**! 
- 🎨 In 2021 I started a business on Etsy selling abstract art [**here**](https://www.etsy.com/your/shops/me/pattern/editor/design), and some of my earlier work is [**here**](https://github.com/georgemarklow/georgemarklow/blob/main/painting.md)
